        <h1>Updating ORB-Hub</h1>
      </div>
      <h2>Background.</h2>
      <p>
        We previously did a tutorial on how to update the ORB University section
        of the Hub. In this one, we'll dive a little deeper into web programming
        to understand what you're seeing on screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The software to use is going to be the same, Visual Studio Code, and
        Git; these probably won't change in the near future, or until AI takes
        over…
      </p>
      <p>Also, here are the credentials for GitHub and Google accounts:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Google account
          <ul>
            <li>Email: orbarchitecture@gmail.com</li>
            <li>Password: orbarchitecture2023!</li>
          </ul>
          • GitHub (where the code repository is stored in the cloud)
          <ul>
            <li>orbarchitecture@gmail.com</li>
            <li>orbarchitecture23</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We're going to need them to get access to the code repository, where all
        the code its stored in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't need to memorize everything we get to talk about, neither every
        HTML tag, just as long you understand the syntax and functionality,
        you'll be fine. Don't feel bad whenever not understanding something and
        googling for an answer, it's a normal workflow.
      </p>
      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the skeleton of every website you
        visit, holding all the content in place. Hence on the word “content”, it
        only stores what you input and nothing more, it can be text, images,
        links, videos, etc., but it doesn't include their style or how they
        look. That's when CSS comes in.
      </p>
      <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        Think of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as the style of the whole website,
        its haircut, makeup, shape, etc. It handles from very simple stuff like
        fonts, text size/color, to more advanced styling like drop-shadows,
        gradients, layouts, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>What Do Now</h3>
      <p>
        Those were some brief descriptions of what HTML and CSS can do, we’re
        barely tipping our toes in the topic, but hopefully, this guide will
        help you learn the basics of them, and hopefully you’d feel comfortable
        editing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll start by editing a simple website as an exercise before jumping to
        edit the actual ORB-Hub code, so we can grasp the basics first.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting to Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Next, download the practice files here. We’ll be doing a small edit to
        the code from those files to get you familiarized with it and have a
        learn-by-doing basis of the workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can come back anytime to have a refresh on the topics we’re going to
        talk about.
      </p>
      <h3>Analyzing the Code</h3>
      <p>
        VS Code window should look like this. At the left we got the file
        explorer, we can see one folder and two files. The folder contains one
        file so far, being the ORB Logo. Can you guess what are the other two
        files? You may have guessed it right, “index.html” contains all the
        content of the website, whereas “style.css” holds the aesthetic of the
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please go ahead and open the index file in your preferred browser so we
        can see the entirety of the website.
